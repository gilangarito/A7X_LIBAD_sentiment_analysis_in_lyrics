I am the man
Six days of bullshit, a wave of my hand
And you know what I need
Put your hands together, get down on your knees
Or climb a hill and just don't talk
I never made a man didn’t trip when they walk the walk

It's so chic, and we love
What you've done with the place
Compliments you with style and grace

Can’t tell me that all I see ain't a gift from the fabulous one
Thought about a name that came to me, can you explain why the phone would ring?
Prayed so hard, and oh my Lord, I got a spot at the front of the lot
Can't be late for my weekly date 'cause we're gonna save someone

What?
What have I done?
Jesus Christ
You gotta be kidding me

I am the plan
Cheap imitations by obsessive fans
But you're great and fun to watch
On the seventh day, I thought about world peace, but I decided just to take it off

It's so chic, and we love
What you've done with the place
Compliments you with style and grace

Can’t tell me that all I see ain’t a gift from the fabulous one
